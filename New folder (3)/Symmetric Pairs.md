**Two pairs (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) are said to be symmetric pairs if X1 = Y2 and X2 = Y1.**

**Write a query to output all such symmetric pairs in ascending order by the value of X. List the rows such that X1 â‰¤ Y1.**

# solution 

```sql
select  a.x, a.y 
from functions as a join functions as b 
on  a.x = b.y and b.x = a.y
where a.x <= a.y
group by 1,2
having count(*) >1 or a.x < a.y
order by a.x
```
